The project was originally implemented in R, which I converted to a python implementation using ChatGpt
Paper: https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/9861752
python=3.12
How to use:
  Install the pachages in the attach docments
  Write you peptdes into the file "text.fasta" line by line , just paste the peptides from excel, don't use fasta format please, because the programa will do it automatically.
  Open python in terminal at the this folder
  Type"python main.py trainingdata.csv text2.fasta" #text2.fasta will be generated automatically
